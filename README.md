# PasswordGenerator
This is a password generator that outputs a password to the console.
Currently, it allows for the character set to be altered based on need.
---
KNOWN BUGS:
- There is an issue with the validation of whitespaces.
    - This allows frequent occurrences of generated passwords without spaces despite the paramater being set to true.
